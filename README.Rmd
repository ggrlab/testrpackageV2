The goal of testrpackageV2 is to ...

## Installation

You can install the development version of testrpackageV2 like so:

``` r
# FILL THIS IN! HOW CAN PEOPLE INSTALL YOUR DEV PACKAGE?
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(testrpackageV2)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.


# How was this package created

```r
# for VSCode
install.packages("languageserver")
install.packages("devtools")
usethis::create_tidy_package("/home/gugl/clonedgit/mwe/testrpackageV2")
usethis::use_tidy_style(strict = TRUE)
# go into the folder and open the project
setwd("/home/gugl/clonedgit/mwe/testrpackageV2")
usethis::use_git()
```

``usethis`` tells you to envoke further github-related commands. To be able to call them, you need to have your package pushed to github already. 
For this, you first have to create a repository on github and then push your package to it.
```bash
git remote add origin git@github.com:ggrlab/testrpackagev2.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

```{r}
# usethis::create_github_token()
## use_github() has been done by creating the repository and pushing the package to it
# usethis::use_github()  
## except for: (See https://usethis.r-lib.org/reference/use_github.html)
usethis::use_github_links()  # Changes DESCRIPTION

usethis::use_tidy_github_actions()
usethis::use_tidy_github_labels()
